    <h5>I'm originally from Caracas, Venezuela where I worked in the automotive industry for about 8 years, out of which I spent 3 and a half in Japan working for Toyota Motor Corporation. I decided to move to Denver in 2014 when I had an opportunity to help the Stanley Brothers with their hemp company. Worked with Hemp and CBD for 5 years and then the pandemic hit. After that I worked at a wine shop for a little bit to pursue my passion for wines.</h3>
    <h5>I received a B.S. in Industrial Engineering from the Universidad Santa Maria in Caracas, Venezuela. I live a stone's throw away from University of Denver, where I share my house with my wife and 3 and a half year old son and our 3 dogs.</h3>
